==Here are the details.== To begin with, the charity sale will be ==conducted== at 2 p.m. next Monday at school playground and last for the whole afternoon. Moreover, for those who would like to sell their personal belongings, preparing something interesting or useful is expected. Most importantly, since ==the event is predicted to attract a considerable number of students and faculty members==, please always keep the ground clean.
